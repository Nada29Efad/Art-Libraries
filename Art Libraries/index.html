Are we at the mercy of time? one thing dali makes very clear, is that time passes but leaves behind memories; The message of the painting is often interpreted as a surrealist meditation on the fludity and valadity of time. it challanges conventional "hard objects " like clocks by rendering them as soft, melting forms, shaking our usual understanding os time.
